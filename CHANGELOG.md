## [Unreleased]

## [1.2.0] - 2026-05-19

### Added

- Deep-dive audit (`AUDIT.md`) and regression tests for queue, picker, and settings edge cases.
- Click engine unit tests with 88%+ line coverage and pytest `cov-fail-under` gate.
- Welford running timing stats for O(1) status polling (`PERFORMANCE.md`).
- Configurable PyAutoGUI failsafe (default on), runaway CPS guard, optional pause when unfocused.
- Session log at `%APPDATA%/WindowsAutoclicker/sessions.log`.
- AppData settings path with one-time CWD legacy migration (`.migrated` marker beside legacy file).
- `AutoclickerController`, `app/hotkeys`, `app/tray`, and `gui/sections/` layout.

### Fixed

- Click queue counter and processor re-queue bugs.
- Settings validation on non-numeric strings and invalid `interval_unit`.
- Exception `.reason` / `details` contract; coordinate validation tests.
- Coordinate picker hook handle + ESC cancel; quit persists UI settings.
- Hotkey/tray errors surface in the status bar.

### Changed

- CI: unit tests and coverage are required (no `continue-on-error` on test steps).
- Ruff/mypy: removed blanket production ignores; narrowed per-module rules.
